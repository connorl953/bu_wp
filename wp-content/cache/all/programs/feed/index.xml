										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Program Length:</strong> 4-5 years</p>
<p><strong>Location: </strong><span class="s1">University of Washington, Seattle, Washington</span></p>
<p><strong>Admissions Req:<br />
</strong><span class="s1">• The Bioresource Science and Engineering (BSE) is a capacity-constrained major, which means that given the nature of requirements and projects, there is a limit to the number of students that the program can accommodate, even if you have met all of the criteria.<br />
</span><span class="s1">• Students interested in BSE will be part of the College of the Environment but must <a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply through</a> the College of Engineering<br />
</span>• Note that the <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/students/degrees-and-courses/undergraduate-degrees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">College of the Environment</a> actually offers eight undergraduate majors and 9 minors! This program (Bioresource Science and Engineering) is just one of them!</p>
<p><strong>Highlight: </strong><span class="s1">Are you passionate about the world’s natural resources but also enjoy mathematics and applying it to real world concepts? Well if that is the case why not seek a degree in <a href="https://sefs.uw.edu/students/undergraduate/bse-major/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bioresource Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington where you can combine your abilities in mathematics and chemistry to your passion for bioresources. This program is a five year chemical science program that can be combined with chemical engineering, enabling you to pursue both the environment and the importance of biomass resources alongside the theories of engineering. <a href="https://sefs.uw.edu/students/undergraduate/bse-major/bse-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Through pursuing this degree</a> you would be able to gain the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of both science and engineering to be able to access a career in any chemical or manufacturing engineering jobs. There is a requirement of a minimum 3 month internship though many students often do 6 -12 month <a href="https://sefs.uw.edu/students/undergraduate/bse-major/bse-internship-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internships&#8230;that are  PAID</a> at a rate of $2500-$4000/month so you will definitely have work experience when you graduate! Your interests in the environment can be further pursued through the latter years of this program where you will be taught chemical analysis of biomass, use of natural non-wood products, thermal conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals, readily preparing your for any aspect of the engineering sector and in particular the chemical engineering sector. It is said that “chemical engineering is the engineering of the future, one that will change our planet to push us towards sustainability” so why not begin being an active part of changing our planet’s future and pursue Bioresource Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. </span></p>
<p><strong>Cost:<br />
</strong><span class="s1">Home student tuition: $12,076 USD<br />
</span><span class="s1">Non- Resident tuition: $39,906 USD</span></p>
<p><a href="https://admit.washington.edu/costs/scholarships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scholarships and Financial Aid</a> are of course available</p>

Our brains process things differently than our ancestors, and Northwestern University is introducing their <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/about/"><span class="s2">Whole Brain Engineering</span></a> program that will get students to analyze things with both sides of the brain. If you like both the arts and engineering, you don’t have to choose because now you can experience both at the same time. <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/academics/undergraduate/areas-of-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As an engineering major</a> at the McCormick School of Engineering, you get the chance to work on cool projects such as “No wires, More cuddles”, where you work with medical students to help newborn babies. Working on real world cool projects happens in your first year of the program, so as a student who is part of this whole brain engineering program, you will be introduced to the Segal Design Institute and have an opportunity to build and integrate cool projects into a real world context &#8212; such as hospitals. There’s <a href="https://admissions.northwestern.edu/faqs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so much to explore</a> within this program! So why not consider a college experience that considers all of your interests?</span></p>
<p><strong>Cost: </strong><span class="s1">$60,276 USD but</span>  <a href="https://admissions.northwestern.edu/tuition-aid/index.html#tab-panel1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Aid</a> is available for pretty much everyone.</p>

The benefits of technology are being discovered by an expanding number of firms in finance, banking, computing, supply chain, etc. and this blockchain program aims to close a significant gap between supply of academic knowledge in the fields of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology and the high demand for it. Leading academics and industry professionals from all around the world will instruct you in this blockchain program. In fact, you’ll be a part of the world’s largest blockchain student community in this program with more than 900 students registered since 2014. Find employment opportunities as a developer, consultant, regulator, business analyst, financial analyst, and even become a startup entrepreneur. Scholarships are even available as well! Nothing should get in your way!. There is a program to suit every level of interest: a Free 12 week MOOC with no previous knowledge required to get you feet wet, 3 options for Academic Certifications (each 18 weeks to complete), and the 3 semester Master’s Program (with P/T and F/T and online and in-person options!). It’s a node-brainer! Checkout the blockchain program option that can work for you, today!</span></p>
